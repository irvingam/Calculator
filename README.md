# Calculator Application

- This is a basic calculator app made using HTML, CSS Flexbox and Grid, and Javascript.

- I built this app using a varity of resources from Youtube, Stackoverflow, and Reddit.

- This basic calculator can do basic functions and operations such as multipication, division, addition, and subtaction.

- Decimal places are given but don't account for significant figures.
